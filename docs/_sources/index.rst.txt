An open source REST and realtime API layer for modern applications.

Feathers is *a batteries included but entirely optional* minimal web
application framework.

At its core, Feathers is a set of tools and an architecture pattern that
make it easy to create scalable REST APIs and real-time applications.
With Feathers, you can literally build prototypes in minutes and
production-ready apps in days.

Feathers achieves this by being the glue code between some amazing
battle-tested open-source technologies - adding a few minimal
abstractions and introducing an application architecture that is easier
to understand, maintain, and scale than the traditional MVC
architecture.
