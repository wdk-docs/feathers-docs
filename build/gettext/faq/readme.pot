msgid "What Node versions does Feathers support"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:10
msgid "The latest version of Feathers and all plugins work with Node 6 and later. Node 6 will be supported until **2019-04-18** when the official support cycle ends."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:14
msgid "The `Feathers guides <https://docs.feathersjs.com/>`_ and applications generated by the CLI (``@feathersjs/cli``) use newer language features like ``async/await`` and require Node 8 or later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:21
msgid "How do I create custom methods?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:23
msgid "One important thing to know about Feathers is that it only exposes the official :doc:`../api/services` to clients. While you can add and use any service method on the server, it is **not** possible to expose those custom methods to clients."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:28
msgid "Feathers is built around the `REST architectural constraints <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints>`_ and there are many good reasons for it. In general, almost anything that may require custom methods or RPC style actions can also be done either by creating a :doc:`../api/services` or through :doc:`../api/hooks`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:35
msgid "The benefits (like security, predictability, sending well defined real-time events) so far heavily outweighed the slight change in thinking required when conceptualizing your application logic."

msgid "Send email action that does not store mail message in database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:43
msgid "Resources (services) don’t have to be database records. It can be any kind of resource (like the current weather for a city or creating an email which will send it). Sending emails is usually done with either a separate email :doc:`../api/services`:"

msgid "How do I do nested or custom routes?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:113
msgid "Normally we find that they actually aren’t needed and that it is much better to keep your routes as flat as possible. For example something like ``users/:userId/posts`` is - although nice to read for humans - actually not as easy to parse and process as the equivalent :doc:`../api/databases/querying`. Additionally, this will also work much better when using Feathers through websocket connections which do not have a concept of routes at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:121
msgid "However, nested routes for services can still be created by registering an existing service on the nested route and mapping the route parameter to a query parameter like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:152
msgid "Now going to ``/users/123/posts`` will call ``postService.find({ query: { userId: 123 } })`` and return all posts for that user."

msgid "For more information about URL routing and parameters, refer to :doc:`../api/express`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:158
msgid "URLs should never contain actions that change data (like ``post/publish`` or ``post/delete``). This has always been an important part of the HTTP protocol and Feathers enforces this more strictly than most other frameworks. For example to publish a post you would call ``.patch(id, { published: true })``."

msgid "Can you support another database?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:167
msgid "Feathers :doc:`../api/databases/adapters` implement 90% of the functionality you may need to use Feathers with certain databases and ORMs. However, even if your favourite database or ORM is not on the list or the adapter does not support specific functionality you are looking for, Feathers can still accomodate all your needs by :doc:`../api/services`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:174
msgid "To use Feathers properly it is very important to understand how services work and that all existing database adapters are just services that talk to the database themselves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:178
msgid "The why and how to write your own services is covered :doc:`../guides/basics/readme`. In the generator a custom service can be created by running ``feathers generate service``, choosing “A custom service” and then editing the ``<servicename>/<servicename>.class.js`` file to make the appropriate database calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:184
msgid "If you would like to publish your own database adapter, first make sure there isn’t already a `community maintained adapter <https://github.com/feathersjs/awesome-feathersjs#database>`_ for that database (many maintainers are happy to get some help, too). If not, you can run ``feathers generate plugin`` to create a new plugin. A reference implementation for a database adapter can be found in the `feathers-memory repository <https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-memory>`_. It is always possible for community maintained adapters to graduate into an *official* Feathers adapter, at the moment there are however no plans to add support for any new databases from the Feathers team directly."

msgid "Feathers Buzzard (``@feathersjs/feathers@v3.0.0``) introduced a new, more secure event system that does **not** send real-time events by default. If you are not getting real-time events on the client, it is usually a problem with the :doc:`../api/channels` setup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:202
msgid "Have a look a the example at `feathersjs.com <https://feathersjs.com/>`_, the :doc:`../guides/basics/real-time` and the :doc:`../api/channels`. If you are migrating from a previous version, also see the :doc:`../migrating#adding-channels`."

For example, ``findOrCreate`` can be implemented as a before-hook on the service’s ``get`` method. `See this gist <https://gist.github.com/marshallswain/9fa3b1e855633af00998>`_ for an example of how to implement this in a before-hook."

msgid "Why are you using JWT for sessions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:243
msgid "Feathers is using `JSON web tokens (JWT) <https://jwt.io/>`_ for its standard authentication mechanism. Some articles like `Stop using JWT for sessions <http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/>`_ promotes using standard cookies and HTTP sessions. While it brings up some valid points, not all of them apply to Feathers and there are other good reasons why Feathers relies on JWT:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:251
msgid "Feathers is designed to support many different transport mechanisms, most of which do not rely on HTTP but do work well with JWT as the authentication mechanism. This is even already the case for websockets where an established connection normally is not secured by a traditional HTTP session."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:256
msgid "By default the only thing that Feathers stored in the JWT payload is the user id. It is a stateful token. You can change this and make the token stateless by putting more data into the JWT payload but this is at your discretion. Currently the user is looked up on every request after the JWT is verified to not be expired or tampered with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:261
msgid "You need to make sure that you revoke JWT tokens or set a low expiration date or add custom logic to verify that a user’s account is still valid/active. Currently the default expiration is 1 day. We chose a reasonable default for most apps but depending on your application this might be too long or too short."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:267
msgid "Additionally, it is still possible to use Feathers with existing *traditional* Express session mechanism by using :doc:`../api/express`. For example, ``params.user`` for all service calls from a traditional Express session can be passed like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:280
msgid "How do I render templates?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:282
msgid "Feathers works just like Express so it’s the exact same. We’ve created a :doc:`../guides/advanced/using-a-view-engine`. For protecting Express views with authentication, also see :doc:`../guides/auth/recipe.express-middleware`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:287
msgid "OAuth is not setting the cookie"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:289
msgid "If you are authenticating via oAuth but your API and frontend reside on different domains the cookie used by the authentication client can not be set. Instead, a query string redirect has to be used as shown in `this gist <https://gist.github.com/marshallswain/3c9e5b3b177b977468b5b711b6254f67>`_."

msgid "How do I do validation?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:303
msgid "If your database/ORM supports a model or schema (ie. Mongoose or Sequelize) then you have 2 options."

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:343
msgid "The preferred way"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:309
msgid "You perform validation at the service level :doc:`../api/hooks`. This is better because it keeps your app database agnostic so you can easily swap databases without having to change your validations much."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:313
msgid "If you write a bunch of small hooks that validate specific things it is easier to test and also slightly more performant because you can exit out of the validation chain early instead of having to go all the way to the point of inserting data into the database to find out if that data is invalid."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:319
msgid "If you don’t have a model or schema then validating with hooks is currently your only option. If you come up with something different feel free to submit a PR!"

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:335
msgid "How do I do associations?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:337
msgid "Similar to validation, it depends on if your database/ORM supports models or not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:345
msgid "For any of the feathers database/ORM adapters you can just use :doc:`../api/hooks` to fetch data from other services."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:348
msgid "This is a better approach because it keeps your application database agnostic and service oriented. By referencing the services (using ``app.service().find()``, etc.) you can still decouple your app and have these services live on entirely separate machines or use entirely different databases without having to change any of your fetching code. We show how to associate data in a hook in the :doc:`../guides/chat/processing`. An alternative are the `fastJoin <https://feathers-plus.github.io/v1/feathers-hooks-common/#fastjoin>`_ or `populate <https://feathers-plus.github.io/v1/feathers-hooks-common/#populate>`_ in `feathers-hooks-common <https://feathers-plus.github.io/v1/feathers-hooks-common/>`_."

msgid "Sequelize models and associations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:396
msgid "If you are using the `Sequelize <http://docs.sequelizejs.com/>`_ adapter, understanding SQL and Sequelize first is very important. See the `associations section in the feathers-sequelize documentation <https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-sequelize#associations>`_ for more information on how to associate models using the Sequelize Feathers adapter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:403
msgid "What about Koa/Hapi/X?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:405
msgid "There are many other Node server frameworks out there like Koa, a *“next generation web framework for Node.JS”* using ES6 generator functions instead of Express middleware or HapiJS etc. Currently, Feathers is framework independent but only provides an :doc:`../api/express` integration for HTTP APIs. More frameworks may be supported in the future with direct `Node HTTP <https://nodejs.org/api/http.html>`_ being the most likely."

msgid "How do I access the request object in hooks or services?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:415
msgid "In short, you shouldn’t need to. If you look at the :doc:`../api/hooks` you’ll see all the params that are available on a hook."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:418
msgid "If you still need something from the request object (for example, the requesting IP address) you can simply tack it on to the ``req.feathers`` object :doc:`../api/express#params` or :doc:`../api/socketio#appconfiguresocketiocallback`."

msgid "How do I do some processing after sending the response to the user?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:432
msgid "The hooks workflow allows you to handle these situations quite gracefully. It depends on the promise that you return in your hook. Here’s an example of a hook that sends an email, but doesn’t wait for a success message."

If you don’t think there are that many services or event listeners you may have a memory leak. Otherwise you can increase the number in the :doc:`../api/socketio` via ``io.sockets.setMaxListeners(number)`` and with :doc:`../api/primus` via ``primus.setMaxListeners(number)``. ``number`` can be ``0`` for unlimited listeners or any other number of how many listeners you’d expect in the worst case."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/readme.rst:487
msgid "on the client the ``context.params`` object will only be available in your client side hooks. It will not be provided to the server. The reason for this is because ``context.params`` on the server usually contains information that should be server-side only. This can be database options, whether a request is authenticated, etc. If we passed those directly from the client to the server this would be a big security risk. Only the client side ``context.params.query`` and ``context.params.headers`` objects are provided to the server."
