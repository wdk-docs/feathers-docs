If you see something that you can contribute, we would LOVE a pull request with your edits! To make this easy you can click the *“Edit this page”* link at the top of the web docs."

msgid "You’ll notice that the `GitHub Repo <https://github.com/feathersjs/docs>`_ is organized in a nice logical folder structure. The first file in each chapter is named as a description of the entire chapter’s topic. For example, the content related to databases is located in ``api/databases/``."

msgid "Some of the chapters are split into multiple sections to help break up the content and make it easier to digest. You can easily see how chapters are laid out by looking at the ``SUMMARY.md`` file. This convention helps keep chapters together in the file system and easy to view either directly on github or gitbook."
