msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/authentication/oauth1.rst:96
msgid "This is the verification class that handles the OAuth1 verification by looking up the entity (normally a ``user``) on a given service and either creates or updates the entity and returns them. It has the following methods that can all be overridden. All methods return a promise except ``verify``, which has the exact same signature as `passport-oauth1 <https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-oauth1>`_."

msgid "By default the ``Verifier`` takes everything returned by the provider and attaches it to the ``entity`` (ie. the user object) under the provider name. You will likely want to customize the data that is returned. This can be done by adding a ``before`` hook to both the ``update`` and ``create`` service methods on your ``entity``\\ ’s service."
