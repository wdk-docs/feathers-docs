msgid "Primus sockets are also used to *call* service methods. Using sockets for both, calling methods and receiving real-time events is generally faster than using :doc:`./rest` and there is no need to use both, REST and websockets in the same client application at the same time."

msgid "In the browser, the connection can be established by loading the client from ``primus/primus.js`` and instantiating a new ``Primus`` instance. Unlike HTTP calls, websockets do not have a cross-origin restriction in the browser so it is possible to connect to any Feathers server."
