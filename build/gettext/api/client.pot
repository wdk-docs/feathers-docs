msgid "One of the most notable features of Feathers is that it can also be used as the client. In contrast with most other frameworks, it isn’t a separate library; instead you get the exact same functionality with a client and on a server. This means you can use :doc:`./hooks` and configure plugins. By default, a Feathers client automatically creates services that talk to a Feathers server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/api/client.rst:12
msgid "In order to connect to a Feathers server, a client creates :doc:`./services` that use a REST or websocket connection to relay method calls and allow listening to :doc:`./events` on the server. This means the :ref:`Feathers application instance <api_feathersjs-client>` is usable the exact same way as on the server."
