msgid "The Auk release of FeathersJS includes a powerful new :doc:`../../api/authentication/server` built on top of `PassportJS <http://www.passportjs.org/>`_. This now gives the Feathers community access to hundreds of authentication strategies from the Passport community. Since many of the Passport strategies are for OAuth, we’ve created two auth plugins, :doc:`../api/authentication/oauth1` and :doc:`../api/authentication/oauth2`. These new plugins use a Passport strategy to allow OAuth logins into your app."

#: ../../source/guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.rst:15
msgid "Adding OAuth authentication to your app is a great way to quickly allow users to login. It allows the user to use an existing Internet account with another service to login to your app. Among lots of good reasons, it often eliminates the need for the email address verification dance. This is even more likely for very common OAuth providers, like GitHub, Google, and Facebook."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.rst:22
msgid "Simplified login is almost always a good idea, but for many developers implementing OAuth can be difficult. Let’s take a look at how it works, in general. After that, we’ll see how the new :doc:`../api/authentication/server` server plugin makes it easy to get up and running."

#: ../../source/guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.rst:36
msgid "You register your application with the OAuth Provider. This includes giving the provider a callback URL (more on this later). The provider will give you an app identifier and an app secret. The secret is basically a special password for your app."

msgid "You direct the user’s browser to the OAuth provider’s site, providing the app identifier in the query string."

#: ../../source/guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.rst:42
msgid "The content provider uses the app identifier to retrieve information about your app. That information is then presented to the user with a login form. The user can grant or deny access to your application."

msgid "Upon making a decision, the provider redirects the user’s browser to the callback URL you setup in the first step. It includes a short-lived authorization code in the querystring."

#: ../../source/guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.rst:48
msgid "Your server sends a request to the OAuth provider’s server. It includes the authorization code and the secret. If the authorization code and secret are valid, the provider returns an OAuth access token to your server. Some user data can also be sent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/auth/recipe.oauth-basic.rst:52
msgid "Your server can save the user information into the ``/users`` table. It can also use this access token to make requests to the provider’s API. This same information can also be sent to the browser for use."

msgid "With Feathers, there is an additional step. After logging in, a JWT access token is stored in a cookie and sent to the browser. The client uses the JWT to authenticate with the server on subsequent requests."

Since we haven’t logged in, yet, we don’t have a stored JWT access token. Now, click the ``Login with GitHub`` button. Assuming you haven’t logged in to Github with this application, before, you’ll see a GitHub login page. Once you login to GitHub, you’ll be redirected back to ``http://localhost:3030``. Now, if you look at your console, you should see a success message."

The entire OAuth process that we described earlier took place. The browser received a ``feathers-jwt`` cookie from the server. Finally the script that we added in the last step used the ``feathers-authentication-client`` to authenticate using the JWT returned from the server. There were a lot of steps that happened in a very short time. The best news is that you’re authenticated with OAuth."

You can now build nearly any authentication experience imaginable. In the final part of this guide, you were able to authenticate the Feathers client. Hopefully this will get you started integrating OAuth into your application."
