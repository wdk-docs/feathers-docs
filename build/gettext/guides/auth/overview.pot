msgid "In the previous ``feathers-authentication`` plugin, there were two auth endpoints: ``/auth/local`` was for username and password login. ``/auth/token`` was for JWT-based login. In making the latest version, we decided that auth could be more like the rest of Feathers. We created an ``/authentication`` service. This single endpoint handles both ``local``, and ``jwt`` logins, and more."
