msgid "The Auk release of FeathersJS includes a powerful new :doc:`../../api/authentication/server` built on top of `PassportJS <http://www.passportjs.org/>`_. The new plugins are very flexible, allowing you to customize nearly everything. We can leverage this to create completely custom authentication strategies using `Passport Custom <https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-custom>`_. Let’s take a look at two such examples in this guide."

msgid "The second strategy we’ll look at is for an anonymous user. For this specific flow we’ll expect the client to call the ``/authentication`` endpoint letting us know that it wants to authenticate anonymously. The server will then create a new user and return a new JWT token that the client will have to use from that point onwards."
