msgid "``feathers-authentication@1.x`` allows you to customize the data stored inside the JWT. We refer to the data in the JWT as the ``payload``. There are a few reserved attributes, which in the `Official JWT Spec <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519>`_ are called ``claims``. You can customize some of these claims in the :ref:`api_auth_server-otions`. To get more familiar with the purpose of each ``claim``, please refer to `Section 4 of the Official JWT Specification <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4>`_."
