msgid "We just created a ``users`` service and enabled local authentication. When restarting the application, we can now create a new user with ``email`` and ``password``, similar to what we did with messages. The login information is then processed into a JWT (JSON Web Token). (For more information see the :doc:`../auth/how-jwt-works`)."

If we had run ``feathers generate authentication`` *before* generating other services, ``feathers generate service`` would have asked if the service should be restricted to authenticated users. However, since we created the messages service first, we now have to update ``src/services/messages/messages.hooks.js`` manually to look like this:"
