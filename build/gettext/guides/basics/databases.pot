msgid "In the :doc:`./services` we created a custom in-memory messages service that can create, update and delete messages. You can probably imagine how we could implement the same thing using a database instead of storing the messages in memory so there isn’t really a database that Feathers doesn’t support."

msgid "Writing all that code yourself is pretty repetitive and cumbersome though which is why Feathers has a collection of pre-built services for different databases. They offer most the basic functionality and can always be fully customized to your requirements using :doc:`./hooks`. Feathers database adapters support a common :doc:`../../api/databases/common`, pagination and :doc:`../../api/databases/querying` for many popular databases and NodeJS ORMs:"
