msgid "As we have seen in the :doc:`./services`, Feathers services are a great way to implement data storage and modification. Technically, we could implement all our application logic within services but very often an application requires similar functionality across multiple services. For example, we might want to check for all services if a user is allowed to even call the service method or add the current date to all data that we are saving. With just using services we would have to implement this again every time."

#: ../../source/guides/basics/hooks.rst:13
msgid "This is where Feathers hooks come in. Hooks are pluggable middleware functions that can be registered **before**, **after** or on \\__error__s of a service method. You can register a single hook function or create a chain of them to create complex work-flows."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/basics/hooks.rst:18
msgid "Just like services themselves, hooks are *transport independent*. They are usually also service agnostic, meaning they can be used with ​\\ *any*\\ ​ service. This pattern keeps your application logic flexible, composable, and much easier to trace through and debug."

msgid "Hook functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/basics/hooks.rst:54
msgid "A hook function is a function that takes the `hook context <#hook-context>`_ as the parameter and returns that context or nothing. Hook functions run in the order they are registered and will only continue to the next once the current hook function completes. If a hook function throws an error, all remaining hooks (and possibly the service call) will be skipped and the error will be returned."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/guides/basics/hooks.rst:61
msgid "A common pattern to make hooks more re-usable (e.g. making the ``createdAt`` property name from the example above configurable) is to create a wrapper function that takes those options and returns a hook function:"
