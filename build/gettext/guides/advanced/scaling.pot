msgstr ""

msgid "The types of transports used in a feathers application will impact the scaling configuration. For example, a feathers app that uses the ``feathers-rest`` adapter exclusively will require less scaling configuration because HTTP is a stateless protocol. If using websockets (a stateful protocol) through the ``feathers-socketio`` or ``feathers-primus`` adapters, configuration may be more complex to ensure websockets work properly."

msgid "`Cluster <https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html>`_ support is built into core NodeJS. Since NodeJS is single threaded, clustering allows you to easily distribute application requests among multiple child processes (and multiple threads). Clustering is a good choice when running feathers in a multi-core environment."

#: ../../source/guides/advanced/scaling.rst:35
msgid "Below is an example of adding clustering to feathers with the ``feathers-socketio`` provider. By default, websocket connections begin via a handshake of multiple HTTP requests and are upgraded to the websocket protocol. However, when clustering is enabled, the same worker will not process all HTTP requests for a handshake, leading to HTTP 400 errors. To ensure a successful handshake, force a single worker to process the handshake by disabling the http transport and exclusively using the ``websocket`` transport."

msgid "There are notable side effects to be aware of when disabling the HTTP transport for websockets. While all modern browsers support websocket connections, there is no websocket support for `IE <=9 and Android Browser <=4.3 <http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets>`_. If you must support these browsers, use alternative scaling strategies."
