Help!
=====

There are many ways that you can get help but before you explore them
please check the other parts of these docs, the
:doc:`faq/readme`,
`Stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs>`_,
`Github
Issues <https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Afeathersjs+>`_
and our `Medium publication <https://blog.feathersjs.com/>`_.

If none of those work it’s a very real possibility that we screwed
something up or it’s just not clear. We’re sorry
:disappointed_relieved:. We want to hear about it and are very friendly
so feel free to come talk to us in
`Slack <http://slack.feathersjs.com/>`_ or in the `Russian Telegram
chat <https://t.me/featherjs>`_, `submit your
issue <https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues/new>`_ on Github
or ask on `StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com>`_ using the
`feathersjs <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs>`_
tag.
