"Simple right? We technically could call it a day as we have created a "
"Plugin. However, we probably want to do just a bit more. Generally "
"speaking a Plugin is a :doc:`../api/services`. The fun part is that a "
"Plugin can contain multiple Services which we will create below. This "
"example is going to build out 2 services. The first will allow us to find"
" members of the Feathers Core Team & the second will allow us to find the"
" best state in the United States."
